# VestibularVR Analysis Pipeline

This is the general pipeline for loading, preprocessing, aligning, quality checking and applying basic analysis to the data recorded on the <a href=https://ranczlab.github.io/RPM/>RPM</a> (e.g. running) using <a href=https://harp-tech.org/index.html>HARP devices</a>, eye movements data derived from <a href=https://sleap.ai/>SLEAP</a> and neural data (fiber photometry, Neuropixels).

## Installation

The code mainly relies on <a href=https://github.com/harp-tech/harp-python>harp-python</a> and <a href=https://github.com/SainsburyWellcomeCentre/aeon_mecha>aeon_mecha</a> packages. The proposed setup is to first create an Anaconda environment for _aeon\_mecha_, install it and then install _harp-python_ inside of this same environment. Optional packages required by some of the example Jupyter notebooks, but not essential for the main pipeline, are cv2, ffmpeg.

### Install _aeon\_mecha_

```python
...
```

### Install _harp-python_

### Proposed approach to project structure
